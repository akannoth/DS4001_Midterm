## Package Overview

```{r GoogleVisPic, out.width= "100%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="The Google Logo"}
knitr::include_graphics("Logo.png")
```

The package was intended to act as an **interface between R and Google Charts**. The goal was to allow R users to take advantage and create interactive Google chart visualizations without having to upload their data to Google.

```{r HansPic, out.width= "65%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="Hans Rosling at his TED talk"}
knitr::include_graphics("Hans.png")
```

In 2006, **Hans Rosling** gave an inspiring TED talk about social and economic developments, heavily utilizing data analytics. To better communicate his findings, he and coworkers at *Gapminder* created animated charts. The link to his TED talk can be found [here]().

This would popularize the idea or utilization of interactive charts. After *Gapminder* was bought by Google, the authors of the googleVis were inspired by Roslingâ€™s talks and the desire to use interactive data visualization tools to foster the dialogue between data analysts and others. Thus, the googleVis package was born.
